This is the completed project of Fishy Business, which is a financial clicker game that aims to teach people the importance of inflation and a person's affect on their market. This project was developed for the LSU Wics Hackathon in the span of a day in collaboration with Alex Hollier, Tyler Gates, Richard Cooper, and Micah Broussard.
